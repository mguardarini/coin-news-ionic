# Coin News

The coin news is an open source app to test ionic framework. 

This app is so easy to use and follow about bitcoin news around the world.

The idea about the app is to merge two different API's [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and [Coindesk API](https://www.coindesk.com/api/).

# Getting Started

First of all, we need to clone this repository and install modules. If you love git like me, please clone the repository with this command:  git clone https://github.com/mguardarini/ionic-app-.git

If you don't familiarize with git, isn't a problem only done download of this repository. 

Next step installs all the libraries we need to run the app. 

> If you using npm: 
    In the folder of the project run the command below: 
* npm install

> if you using yarn:
    in the folder of the project run the command below: 
* yarn install

Now, go to folder of the project and run the command: 

* ionic serve

If you don't know ionic, please, go to [site](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/installation/) and watch the tutorial how you configure your development envirment.

# Structure of the folders
