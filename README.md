This app is so easy to use and follow about bitcoin news around the world.

The idea about the app is to merge two different API's [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and [Coindesk API](https://www.coindesk.com/api/).

# Getting Started

First of all, we need to clone this repository and install modules. If you love git like me, please clone the repository with this command:  git clone https://github.com/mguardarini/ionic-app-.git

If you don't familiarize with git, isn't a problem only done download of this repository. 

Next step installs all the libraries we need to run the app. 

> If you using npm: 
    In the folder of the project run the command below: 
* npm install

> if you using yarn:
    in the folder of the project run the command below: 
* yarn install

Now, go to folder of the project and run the command: 

* ionic serve

If you don't know ionic, please, go to [site](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/installation/) and watch the tutorial how you configure your development envirment.

# Structure of the folders
